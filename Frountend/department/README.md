# HR Management System

The **HR Management System** is an application built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend. The backend uses Django Rest Framework (DRF) to expose APIs, while the frontend is built with React and Axios for handling API calls. This system helps manage employees, roles, and departments, providing functionality for the admin to create, update, and delete records.

## Features

- **Departments**: Admin can create, read, update, and delete departments. A department can have many employees.
- **Roles**: Admin can create, read, update, and delete employee roles. Employees can be assigned specific roles.
- **Employees**: Admin can add, view, update, and delete employees. Employees have attributes like name, email, mobile, role, department, etc.
- **Authentication**: Users can log in and sign up, but only the admin can manage departments, roles, and employees.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup (Django)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Setup the database and migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser (for Django admin access):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The backend API should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.
